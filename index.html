        <h1>Hi</h1>
        <div>Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open source Solid platform. Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning many assumptions about how the web has to work.After graduating Berners-Lee found employment as an engineer for Plessey Telecom located in Poole, Dorset and he worked on distributed transaction systems, message relays, and bar code technology. In 1978 he moved to D.G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset which was run by two of his friends Dennis Nash and John Poole, where he created type-setting software for printers and wrote and a multitasking operating system.

            From June to December in 1980, he worked for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) as an independent software engineer. While he was there, he made a proposal for a project based on “hypertext” which would make sharing and updating of information by researchers easier and more convenient. Berners-Lee then devised a prototype system called ENQUIRE to demonstrate how it would work. The name came from a Victorian book called “Enquire Within Upon Everything.”

            After he left CERN in late 1980, Berners-Lee became a Director at John Poole’s Image Computer Systems LTD in Bournemouth, Dorset. For three years he was in charge of the technical side of the company and gained experience in computer networking, graphics and communications software.

            In 1983 Vinton Cerf created the first commercial internet “email” system where information could be shared between individuals using email addresses. Berners-Lee, with his ENQUIRE proposal, wanted to devise a system that was automatically available to everyone.

            Berners-Lee returned to CERN in 1984 as a Fellow and by 1989 CERN was also the largest internet node in the European continent.</div>
